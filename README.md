## Did buying the curtain lead to lower heating bills?

In January 2023, we bought and installed a pair of curtains to insulate the doorway of a poorly-insulated room during cold weather.  
I was curious as to whether this had reduced our energy usage or not, so I decided to use data science to find out.  

Our house has gas central heating, so I can compare our gas usage before and after installation of the curtains.  
This should give an indication of whether the curtains reduced the heating bill.  
Our heating requirements are dependent on the outside temperature, so I need to factor this in to the calculations.
It is also worth noting that our water is heated by gas as well, so this will introduce some noise into the measurements.

The curtains were installed on 29th January. 
Having allowed a couple of months to pass for data collection post-installation, I gathered daily temperature and gas usage data for the previous 12 months. This notebook shows the outcome of that analysis.
